# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Karl Emil James Koch, a Product Designer currently designing the future of long-term investing at [Moneybox](https://www.moneyboxapp.com) in London, UK.

I design and build software, write about the intersection of design and development and create music.

Alongside my day job I'm also the Design Lead for both [Cosmic](https://www.cosmicjs.com) and [Make Me A Cocktail](https://www.makemeacocktail.com), and make lots of Figma utilty plugins over at [Plugins.run](https://www.plugins.run).

Previously, I've worked for [HomeHero](https://www.homehero.co.uk), [NeuerEnergy](https://www.neuerenergy.com), [Cognite](https://www.cognite.co), Incuna and [Apple](https://www.apple.com/uk/retail).

I've got a lot of plugins for Figma.
