# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Karl Emil James Koch, a Product Designer currently designing the Home as a Service at [HomeHero](https://www.homehero.co.uk) in London, UK.

I started out my career with training in psychology and a Masters in Fine Art, creating behaviour-influencing sculptures and digital installations.

Now, having spent my career bringing experience design practices to rare diseases and delivering elegant AI-driven solutions to change the face of renewable energy, I'm designing the future of Home as a Service at HomeHero.

Previously, I've worked for [NeuerEnergy](https://www.neuerenergy.com), [Cognite](https://www.cognite.co), Incuna and [Apple](https://www.apple.com/uk/retail).
